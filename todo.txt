- change C-style casts to C++ cast operators

- htons

- split the code up into functions / modules

- test recv flags


COMMUNICATION THREADS:
- close socket file descriptor on error before exiting (perform clean-up)


ACCEPT WHILE-LOOP:
- continue to next iteration on connection error
- exit on major errors


C, Unix:
- conditional compilation depending on the target platform (Linux, Windows)


C++:
- throw exceptions on errors
    and make a common socket clean-up-point

- conditional compilation depending on the available C++ standard version

- smart pointers with allocation instead of new, delete


DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION:
- test program for memory leaks using valgrind


TESTS:
- kill (sigkil) applications (server, client) at different points of execution

- e.g. server killed != server performed an orderly shutdown !!


TEST SCRIPTS:
- write bash client-server testing script

- unit testing with mocks

SECURITY:
- escape special (e.g. console control) characters from client input!


MAKEFILE:
- -pthread ? C++11 threads
- add compiler flags as flags in makefile
- add linking with libraries (-pthread on Unix) [at the right place of the compile command!]

- should recompilation of server and client depend on changes in signal_handlers.h?


- add -std=c++11 / -std=c++0x
- -std=c++14
- -fext-numeric-literals ??


TCP PACKETS:
- sniff using WireShark +gdb instruction/function stepping 
    +or sleep's in the programs (which system function sends what)
