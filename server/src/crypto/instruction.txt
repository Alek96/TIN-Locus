1. Download the latest Crypto++'s source code from here:
    https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/releases
(there is no preprepared bin file)

2. Compile the Crypto++ library using make

3. Update local Makefile to point to proper include and library directories/files
 (you can copy all the .h files of the Crypto++ to some 'include/crypto++' dir, and the libcryptopp.a (created after the Crypto++ compilation) to some 'lib' dir)

4. Now you can build the Crypto module and test program using the local Makefile.
    Have fun using cryptographic classes.

TODO: Integrate this module with TIN_Locus's CMake system.
